## My mod repository for World of Tanks Blitz!

For tanks:

- To install mods, simple copy the contents from the mod you would like to install, to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\World of Tanks Blitz\Data\3d\Tanks``. Then remove ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\World of Tanks Blitz\Data\3d\Tanks\<country>\<tankname>.sc2.dvpl``.

For maps:

- To install mods, simple copy the contents from the mod you would like to install, to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\World of Tanks Blitz\Data\3d\Maps``. Then remove ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\World of Tanks Blitz\Data\3d\Maps\<country>\<tankname>.sc2.dvpl``.

# Important

- This only works in the Steam version of WoTB!
- Make sure to copy the patched ``.exe`` from "exe 4.8.0" to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\World of Tanks Blitz``
- Some mods may cause crashes (incase of a crash, try disabling suspension in the settings).
- If using a mod in your video, please give credit to me (**Bonking Bliz**) and add a proper link to the YouTube channel [from here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXrqqkN44yGSlx8uzE7Sj8Q)
